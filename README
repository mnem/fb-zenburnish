fb-zenburnish
=============

This file sets your colour scheme within FlashBuilder 4 (b2) to something
approximating the excellent zenburn colour theme that's really rather
popular amongst vimheads.

Quick guide for installing it:

0. Launch FlashBuilder.
1. Choose File -> Export -> Other.
2. Open General and select Preferences.
3. Click next, select "Export all" and "Browse…" to save a backup of your
   current preferences somewhere.
4. Keep that backup safe in case this all goes titsup.
5. Choose File -> Export -> Other.
6. Open General and select Preferences.
7. Browse to where you've downloaded fb-zenburnish.epf and select it. Make
   sure "Import all" is selected, ignore any warnings and hit "Finish".
8. Panic, as your colours look crazy-ass.
9. Choose File -> Restart to reload Eclipse.
10.Exhale gently and let the sublime colours wash, soothingly, through your
   eyeballs, caressing your optic nerves, and then engaging in a group hug
   with your brain.
